AGBÉYOMÉ MESSAM KODJO, PRIME MINISTER OF TOGO1. Mr. MESSAM KODJO (Togo) informed the Commission on Human Rights of hisGovernments support, in particular for the High Commissioner, whose determination anddevotion to the cause of human rights he applauded. The Togolese Government noted withregret the High Commissioners decision not to seek a second term of office.2. He had taken the floor above all to enlighten the international community about theserious and unfounded accusations directed against Togo by Amnesty International. Thoseaccusations had led to the establishment of the United Nations/OAU International Commissionof Inquiry for Togo. Following their inquiry, conducted in Togo, Ghana and Benin, the membersof the commission had concluded that they could neither confirm nor deny the allegations madeby Amnesty International. It could hardly have been otherwise, since the entire affair was a plotto destabilize Togo orchestrated by a number of opponents to the Government.3. Amnesty Internationals accusations that hundreds of civilians and soldiers had beensummarily executed and thrown into the sea were therefore totally unfounded, as had beenadmitted inter alia by representatives of the national press. The accusations were even lessplausible given that foreign observers and NGOs in Togo during the election period had neverheard about the bodies said to have been found floating off the coasts of Togo and Benin. Suchtragic incidents could not have gone unnoticed by all those flocking to Lomé beach.4. Amnesty International had therefore obviously been misled by its informants and hadfailed its mission by not taking the usual precautions it should have in the light of the seriousnessof the incidents. During his visit to Lomé over 10 years earlier, the former Secretary-General ofAmnesty International, Mr. Peter Duffy, had paid tribute to Togos struggle to promote humanrights. It was therefore surprising that in less than 10 years, Togo should have become a State ofterror.5. Togos economic success admittedly stood in the way of those who wanted to reachpower. In spite of the difficult economic situation, Togo had become the hub of the subregion.Togolese banks were flush with cash, earning Togo the nickname, the Switzerland of Africa.The country was respected and admired by its neighbours and many Africans were moving there,contributing to its prosperity.6. Those opposing the party in power, the Togolese Peoples Rally, had started byorganizing armed incursions from the exterior, resulting in a high toll of innocent victims,in 1986, 1993, 1994 and 1998. During the political crisis that had broken out in the countryin 1990, accusations of human rights violations had been pulled out of thin air.7. Togo had been building on democracy and the rule of law since the mid-1980s. It waswith a view to enhancing that process that it had promoted the establishment of trade unions andpolitical parties, of many human rights NGOs, and had guaranteed freedom of the press.---------PAGE ENDED---------E/CN.4/2001/SR.14page 4Although the media had abused that freedom, the Togolese Government had demonstrated greattolerance and the President of the Republic, Mr. A. Adema, had always pardoned journalists whohad been arrested or even convicted.8. The steps taken by the Togolese Government to promote the rule of law and democracyincluded the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission, the ratification of almostall international human rights treaties and increased attention to the strengthening of thejudiciary. In addition, the Supreme Council of Justice, the Constitutional Court and therenovated Supreme Court had been established with a view to consolidating the rule of law.9. In view of the particularly worrisome human rights situation in Africa, Togo wasdetermined to rise to the two major challenges of strengthening democracy and implementing agenuine economic, social and cultural policy. The latter objective required a strong economy.To meet it, strategies would have to be found that favoured sustainable human development, orthe steadily worsening economic situation could lead to a social explosion. The internationalcommunity had to become aware of the pressing appeals that were being launched andunderstand that it was difficult to speak of effective enjoyment of human rights for a populationthat lived below the poverty threshold.10. To meet its objectives, the Togolese Government was implementing a medium-termstrategy aimed both at stabilizing and rehabilitating the macroeconomic framework and at theoptimum allocation of resources, while ensuring that the most vulnerable population sectors wereprotected. It recognized the close connection between development, democracy and humanrights, the threesome established by the World Conference in Vienna in 1993.11. He vigorously declared the need for a policy aimed at integrating all the communities in acountry and at respect for individual fundamental rights. In that regard, the TogoleseGovernment was enthusiastically preparing to contribute to the World Conference againstRacism.STATEMENT BY MS. BENITA FERRERO-WALDNER, MINISTER FOR FOREIGNAFFAIRS OF AUSTRIA12. Ms. FERRERO-WALDNER (Austria) said that her delegation regretted to learn thatMrs. Robinson, who had made a decisive contribution to advancing the cause of human rightsand to strengthening the human rights capacities of the United Nations system, would not beseeking a second term of office.13. Austria saw the Commission on Human Rights as the central engine for the developmentand promotion of human rights worldwide. The Commission had generated two covenants andan impressive number of conventions and declarations. It had established monitoringmechanisms and a network of human rights assistance. It had also introduced the human rightsdimension into new areas and had brought about recognition of the right to development.14. Unfortunately, human rights instruments often remained a dead letter for countlesshuman beings whose most basic rights continued to be grossly violated every day. The---------PAGE ENDED--------- E/CN.4/2001/SR.14 page 5recognition of the imperative need to translate human rights standards into practice had been acentral achievement of the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights. In that respect, theConference had laid a number of foundations.15. The United Nations nevertheless had to reflect on how best to ensure respect for humanrights during conflict, how to incorporate human rights into prevention policies and how toformulate strategies apt to achieve lasting reconciliation on the basis of the rule of law and goodgovernance. In that respect, she expressed satisfaction at the growing importance of humanrights in the United Nations system, in particular in field activities.16. With regard to the often tragic plight of the 20 to 25 million people displaced by conflictaround the world, she paid tribute to the Secretary-Generals representative for internallydisplaced persons, Mr. Francis Deng, for his advocacy on behalf of the internally displaced indialogues with governments and other actors. She had been encouraged to learn of the good usemade by many governments of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement compiled byMr. Deng at the Commissions request and of the establishment of an inter-agency network oninternal displacement. Much remained to be done, however, to find an adequate response to theneeds of internally displaced persons. In that area, the Commission and the High Commissionerfor Human Rights had an important role to play.17. The previous year, as Chairperson-in-Office of the OSCE, she had ensured that one ofthe OSCEs meetings had dealt with migration and internal displacement. Furthermore, theAustrian Government had hosted an international colloquy on internal displacement, and theAustrian delegation would table a draft resolution on the issue at the current session of theCommission.18. Austria unreservedly supported the activities of the Offices of the High Commissionerfor Human Rights in Burundi and Colombia to assist national institutions and civil society. TheOffices endeavoured to deal with the many problems caused by the conflicts in those twocountries, including displacement. Austria had pledged 5 million Austrian schillings in supportof the Burundi Office. It would also support the Colombia Office with its European Unionpartners.19. In order to ensure respect for the principle of non-discrimination both at international andlocal level, Austria was actively participating in the preparations for the World Conferenceagainst Racism. It was honoured to have chaired the preparatory committee for the EuropeanRegional Conference in Strasbourg. The World Conference should make concreterecommendations. It was essential that NGOs be adequately represented at the WorldConference. Mastering the future meant facing up to the past. Austria, for its part, had assumedits moral responsibility and taken measures to settle the claims arising from the Nazi socialist eraor the Second World War. Although the World Conference should focus on a forward-lookingapproach, the participating States should not shy away from facing up to historical injustices inthe framework of a constructive dialogue promoting reconciliation.20. Ethnic minorities were the primary targets of racism, xenophobia and discrimination.The tragedies that had occurred in the former Yugoslavia and the Great Lakes region of Africaproved that negating the rights of minorities figured prominently among the causes of armed---------PAGE ENDED---------E/CN.4/2001/SR.14page 6conflict. In many instances, special measures had to be taken to ensure that the members ofethnic minorities were placed on an equal footing with the rest of the population. In that spirit,Austria would submit to the Commission a draft resolution on The rights of persons belongingto national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities.21. In order to fight more effectively against trafficking in human beings, in particular ofwomen and children for the purpose of sexual exploitation, the international community had toconduct coordinated and interdisciplinary action, involving the countries of origin, transit anddestination. The means of making potential victims aware of the issue, protecting them andhelping them reintegrate into society also had to be strengthened. Austria would sponsor aspecial event on the topic on 9 April 2001.22. The violent acts recently committed by young people against foreigners andasylum-seekers in Europe bore witness to the fact that despite the efforts made, a genuine humanrights culture had not yet taken hold. She had therefore made human rights education a priorityon the Austrian human rights agenda.23. Civil society had to be closely involved in that undertaking. Austria thereforewholeheartedly supported the municipalities in Africa and Latin America that had proclaimedthemselves human rights cities. In Europe, the Austrian city of Graz had become the first toadopt that term.24. Austria strongly believed that to foster the right to development in an increasinglyglobalized economy, national action and international cooperation had to reinforce each other. Ittherefore recognized the growing importance of capital flow to developing countries. Itwelcomed the Heavily-Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and considered the European UnionsEverything but arms project a step towards reducing the resource gap between developing anddeveloped countries.25. She concluded by stating that the world needed concrete measures rather than abstractsolutions. She firmly believed that the complex problems on the Commissions agenda couldonly be solved in a spirit of cooperation.STATEMENT BY MR. JOSCHKA FISCHER, MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS OFGERMANY26. Mr. Joschka FISCHER (Germany) expressed satisfaction at the progress made theprevious year with regard to human rights. The Optional Protocol to the Convention on theElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women had entered into force, and it was tobe hoped that the same would soon apply to the optional protocols on child soldiers and theexploitation of children. In Yugoslavia, Korea and elsewhere, a reduction in tension had allowedpeopled to believe there might be hope.27. The same did not hold true, however, for other parts of the world. In the Middle East, thetwo sides had to refrain from doing anything that could stand in the way of negotiations, the onlymeans of resolving outstanding issues.---------PAGE ENDED--------- E/CN.4/2001/SR.14 page 728. The human rights record worldwide was anything but satisfactory. In more than twothirds of all States, people were being tortured or abused. The fundamental rights of womenwere being violated, the most basic needs of the poor ignored, and children were beingconscripted into combat forces.29. It had not so far been possible to bridge the yawning gap between rich and poorcountries. Globalization offered the former greater opportunities than the latter. In order todefeat the threat that the world would be divided along new fault lines as a result of thatimbalance, market forces had to be counteracted by the adoption of measures that were geared topeoples needs. In the age of globalization, a society could be successful only if it respected therights of the individual, including the creativity and freedom that would be the single mostimportant resource in the future. Lasting economic success and social development requiredobservance of human rights and the rule of law.30. Political and civil rights, on the one hand, and social and economic rights, on the other,formed an indivisible whole. Only societies that put the two categories of rights on an equalfooting could develop in the long term. One of the outstanding contributions of theHigh Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, was that she had heightened theinternational communitys awareness of the interdependence of the two categories of rights. Inthat regard, the division between the champions of civil and political rights and the proponents ofsocial and economic rights had proved to be crippling.31. At present, the majority of States - and that had been one of the notable successes ofhuman rights policy - were opposed to impunity for the perpetrators of human rights violations.Everything therefore had to be done to ensure that the International Criminal Court started workas soon as possible. Germany called on all States to safeguard the integrity of the Rome Statuteand to sign and ratify it as soon as possible.32. Germany continued to urge the worldwide abolition of capital punishment, which couldnot be justified either ethically or legally and had not proved to be an effective means ofcombating crime. Germany supported the elaboration of an optional protocol to the Conventionagainst Torture. It would sponsor a draft resolution on the right to adequate housing.33. Priority had to be given to the fight against trafficking in women and girls throughout theworld and to the abominable practice of genital mutilation, for which there was no excuse.Women from all over the world and all walks of life had to have equal rights. In that respect, theCommission should condemn the violations committed in Afghanistan, where women had beendeprived of almost all their rights. Those who had destroyed the magnificent statues at Bamiyanhad, with that symbolic gesture, destroyed the idea of tolerance and living together in harmony,which was the basis for human rights and peace.34. In China, although there was growing awareness that economic modernization andprotection of human rights must go hand in hand, as evidenced by the ratification of theInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Governments readiness tocooperate more closely with the United Nations mechanisms, and the Sino-German dialogue onthe rule of law, the human rights situation unfortunately continued to be a source of concern.Germany called upon China to end the persecution of political dissidents, Christians, Falun Gong---------PAGE ENDED---------E/CN.4/2001/SR.14page 8practitioners and ethnic minorities such as the Tibetans and Uighurs, to stop torture in prisonsand work camps, to abolish the death penalty and to ratify the International Covenant on Civiland Political Rights, for the two Covenants formed a whole.35. In Chechnya, human rights were still being gravely violated by both sides in the war.While Russia had the right and obligation to defend its territorial integrity, the use of force, farfrom solving the Chechen problem, served to exacerbate terrorism and fundamentalism. Alasting solution to the Chechnya problem could only be found politically. Moreover, the RussianFederation had not yet followed up the key demands made by the Commission in the resolutionit had adopted on Chechnya at its previous session. Russia had to engage in political dialogueand negotiations on the peaceful settlement of the conflict and grant the Special Rapporteurs ofthe Commission on Human Rights and the OSCE Assistance Group access to the region. Thecrimes committed in Chechnya had to be systematically investigated and prosecuted. To date,one single Russian soldier had been tried.36. The fight against racism and xenophobia was of particular importance to Germans, who,in the light of their history, proclaimed in article 1 of the Basic Law that the dignity of theindividual is inviolable. They considered the acts of violence committed against foreigners inrecent years to be intolerable and humiliating. The State and society were determined to fight allforms of right-wing radicalism, racism and anti-Semitism, by taking the required measures torepress or prevent such acts.37. The World Conference against Racism could make a difference in the struggle againstxenophobia and racism. It must not only consider past injustices, including apartheid andslavery, but also examine present and future problems. To that end, it should adopt a meaningfuldeclaration and a realistic plan of action.38. Amnesty International, which would be celebrating its fortieth anniversary in 2001, hadproved that NGOs could be very effective against violence, oppression and intolerance. In spiteof their at times differing points of view, NGOs and governments had to unite their effortsagainst racism and xenophobia.39. The fact that human rights had become a fixture of international politics was one reasonfor cautious optimism about the future. There was still, however, a long way to go. Growingawareness that protection of human rights provided the best insurance against war andunderdevelopment gave rise to hope that the rights of the individual would be better protected inthe twenty-first century than in the past.STATEMENT BY MR. FELIPE PÉREZ ROQUE, MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS OFCUBA40. Mr. PÉREZ ROQUE (Cuba) said that the Commission on Human Rights was currentlymore divided than ever and on the verge of reaching an irreversible point of disrepute. On theone hand, there were the representatives of the third world, hostages to debt, victims of the unfairinternational disorder, facing hunger, poverty, illiteracy and mother and child mortality. It wasthose countries, whose suffering had sustained the opulence of their exploiters, which alwaysstood accused at the Commission. On the other hand, there were the representatives of the rich---------PAGE ENDED--------- E/CN.4/2001/SR.14 page 9and developed countries. They were the creditors, those who consumed almost everythingproduced in the world, those who squandered and polluted, forgetting that they owed theirwealth to the third world. They were acting as accusers and judges.41. The time had come to put an end to that hypocrisy and double standard. TheUnited States had to explain why it had voted against considering famine, which affectednearly 1 billion people, as an outrage to human dignity and why, at the same time as it attemptedto accuse Cuba, it refused to condemn the flagrant, large-scale human rights violationscommitted by the Israeli army against the courageous Palestinian people.42. The truth was that the Commission on Human Rights continued to be an instrument inthe service of the interests of the United States and its allies. The time had come to democratizethe Commission. To do so, the developed countries had to recognize that they were not theabsolute owners of the truth and renounce the racist notion that poor people could not be right.They had to be more tolerant and stop trying to impose a single model of democracy. The WorldConference on Human Rights had reaffirmed that all peoples were entitled to self-determinationand, by virtue of that right, were free to establish their political conditions. Cuba would continueto demand that the Commission cease being a hostage to unjustifiable interests, that it respect therights of all countries and that it function in a transparent, objective and democratic manner.43. The United States accused Cuba of human rights violations. Cuba rejected thatdespicable accusation and vigorously affirmed that there were no human rights violations inCuba, that there was no justification whatsoever for the attempt to single out Cuba at theCommission and that the accusation was grounded solely in the pathological incapacity ofthe United States to accept Cuba as an independent country that no longer belonged to it.After 40 years of blockade, economic war, invasions, terrorist acts, assassination plots againstCuban leaders and biological warfare, the United States had decided to use the Commission onHuman Rights to attack Cuba. The United States had the least moral authority of all countries tojudge Cuba over human rights and democracy.44. Contrary to what was happening on a daily basis in many countries, no one had ever seenthe police in Cuba beating up demonstrators, throwing tear gas at them or using dogs or rubberbullets against them. Everyone knew that in Cuba leaders demonstrated alongside the people.The US State Department, in spite of its deep-rooted hatred for Cuba, had been obliged torecognize that there were no politically motivated deaths or disappearances in Cuba. In Cubathere had not been a single case of torture, murder or disappearance, not a single murderedjournalist, not a single instance of a child being sold or kidnapped, other than the attempt toretain a Cuban child in the United States. Cuba had no death squads, no mothers andgrandmothers demonstrating for the return of the bodies of their murdered children andgrandchildren. In Cuba, the Government had never imposed on the people an InternationalMonetary Fund structural adjustment programme and had never given the countrys riches awayto transnational corporations. If after 40 years of blockade and 10 years of dire economicconstraints the Cuban people continued overwhelmingly to support their leaders, it was becausethe authority of those leaders was not based on money or corruption and because, since they hadbeen elected democratically and transparently, they took account of their compatriots needs anddreams and shared their difficulties.---------PAGE ENDED---------E/CN.4/2001/SR.14page 1045. That did not mean that Cuban society was perfect. Cubans were trying to obliteratecenturies of marginalization and injustice, to raise the level of education and strengthen equality,social justice and citizen participation within the framework of a political system that was farmore democratic than that of the United States. Cubans were struggling for an increasinglytolerant, democratic and cultured, and therefore freer society, a society that honoured the dignityof man and was free of violence, repression and deceit.46. The countries seconding the United States in its attempt to accuse Cuba had no moralauthority to talk about human rights. It was not possible to reject the blockade against Cubawhile colluding with the United States in the manipulation to justify it. The peoples ofLatin America knew that the Cubans were struggling for their rights, too. They rememberedCubas solidarity during the time of United States-sponsored dictatorships that tortured,murdered and caused the disappearance of hundreds of thousands of people. They knew thatCuba was fighting for the rights of everyone in the third world, for an end to contempt and theestablishment of a more equitable world.47. No matter what the United States thought, Cuba would never give up its freedom, itsindependence, its socialist ideal, its anti-imperialism and its solidarity with just causes.48. The United States wanted to organize the party calling for the annexation to theUnited States of a fragmented, weak Cuba. All those attempts were doomed to fail as were thehumiliating pressures that the United States was exerting on members of the Commission tocondemn Cuba.49. The United States had turned the Cuban people into the freest on earth, a people that didnot depend on its trade, credits or investment. Cubans enjoyed the rare and almost uniqueprivilege of being able to tell the United States the truth from any rostrum.50. Cuba did not accuse the American people, who were capable of being noble andidealistic. It accused a hegemonic system of domination and the selfish and rapacious politicaland economic order the United States was trying to impose on the world. Cuba had been askedto make a gesture to please the United States. On behalf of his people, the gesture thatMr. Roque had decided to make was to raise his fist and loudly proclaim the words that allCubans had uttered for 40 years, every time they had been the victims of crime and aggressionThe fatherland or death! We shall overcome!STATEMENT BY MR. GARCIA-SAYAN LARRABURE, MINISTER OF JUSTICE OFPERU51. Mr. GARCIA-SAYAN (Peru) paid tribute to the High Commissioner for Human Rights,who had worked to promote human rights throughout the world and to whom he wished everysuccess in her future endeavours.52. Peru had gone through an unprecedented institutional crisis marked by the reign ofimpunity and serious human rights violations. Having settled the crisis peacefully, thetransitional Government headed by Mr. Paniagua was currently re-establishing the democratic---------PAGE ENDED--------- E/CN.4/2001/SR.14 page 11institutions destroyed by years of authoritarianism and corruption, guaranteeing protection ofhuman rights and returning Peru to its previous position within the international democraticsystem.53. As had been reaffirmed at the World Conference on Human Rights held in Viennain 1993, and as proved by Perus experience, well-established democracies with stableinstitutions that took care to respect the rule of law were essential for the implementation ofhuman rights. For that reason, the only ambition of the transitional Government, whose Councilof Ministers was currently presided over by Mr. Javier Perez de Cuellar, former United NationsSecretary-General, was to restore democracy.54. With regard to the administration of justice, the Constitutional Court magistrates who hadbeen removed had been reappointed and the court was fulfilling its role. In addition, electoralcommissions, which had become technically independent bodies, were now able to guaranteefree, fair and transparent elections. In December 2000, the Peruvian Government hadestablished a working group whose task was to pave the way for the establishment of a truthcommission in charge of investigating the cases of thousands of people who had fallen victim toforced disappearances, summary executions and torture in Peru between 1980 and 2000, and toset up a system of compensation for the victims.55. The Government was also drawing up a global anti-corruption strategy. TheAttorney-General had set up an ad hoc office tasked with bringing to book the perpetrators ofcrimes involving the former President, Alberto Fujimori, and his adviser, Vladimir Montesinos.The law of amnesty by which the previous regime had attempted to protect the perpetrators ofserious crimes from justice had been declared null and void. The judicial authorities had beengiven effective tools to fight organized crime in the form of major legislation. Twenty-ninecriminal investigations had been opened involving 150 people playing a key role in criminalorganizations, 25 of whom were being held in custody. Three former armed forces commandersand a number of businessmen and senior civil servants were currently in prison.56. In addition, Peru had re-established its ties with international human rights bodies. TheInter-American Court of Human Rights had just ruled in the case of the summary execution of15 people by the Colina paramilitary group. Two former generals from the IntelligenceService involved in that affair had also been arrested. The Inter-American Commission onHuman Rights currently had a backlog of over 300 cases of severe torture, forced disappearancesand summary executions.57. In addition, the transitional Government had signed a number of international treaties,namely the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, the Inter-American Convention onthe Forced Disappearance of Persons, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on theElimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, and the International Conventionagainst Transnational Organized Crime.58. Peru was strongly in favour of re-enforcing the structures of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights and endorsed the adoption of new international instrumentsexpanding the protection of human rights throughout the world.---------PAGE ENDED---------E/CN.4/2001/SR.14page 1259. He concluded by asking the international community to support the people of Peru intheir historic undertaking to reconstruct democracy.STATEMENT BY MR. GUSTAVO BELL LEMUS, VICE-PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLICOF COLOMBIA60. Mr. BELL LEMUS (Colombia) expressed regret that the High Commissioner for HumanRights had decided not to seek reappointment and paid tribute to her exemplary work andcourage.61. Colombias absolute priority was to bring about national reconciliation through dialogueand political negotiation. Barely two weeks previously, a delegation consisting of over 20countries and international organizations had met with the Government and the rebel groups witha view to keeping abreast of recent progress in the peace process. Following that meeting, it hadbeen decided to establish an official group of likeminded countries to provide the negotiationswith political, moral, technical and economic support. Colombia was counting on that support topursue its work in favour of peace and reconciliation. The overwhelming majority ofColombians supported the Governments efforts and wanted an end to the fighting, for onlyreconciliation and peace could ensure that they could effectively exercise their civil, social,economic and cultural rights.62. Given the complex nature of the situation in the country, great care must be taken not tocome to the hasty and fatalistic conclusion that institutions had collapsed and the Governmenthad no political will. The high rate of citizen participation in the elections of mayors, governorsand regional councillors was evidence of the vitality of democratic institutions and thedetermination of Colombians to live in a democratic State. The State and the Government foundit difficult to deal with the destructive effects of the internal conflict, but they had neverthelessmade unprecedented efforts to modernize institutions and honour their commitments to protecthuman rights. The Government had implemented a far-reaching policy to defend those rightsand international humanitarian law, leading to remarkable progress in the fight against illegalarmed groups (guerrillas and self-defence groups, who were the main agents of the acts ofviolence, including massacres, perpetrated in the country). The Government categoricallydenied accusations that there were ties between criminal groups and the forces of law and orderand declared that all State forces were opposed to the self-defence groups. The Government hadadopted a plan of action and set up a national centre to coordinate the fight against those groups.It had also established a financial brigade in charge of inquiring into the movement of fundsfrom illegal activities and into the entities financing the groups in question. Numerous militaryoperations had been carried out to arrest the members of illegal groups, over 700 of whom werecurrently in prison. With a view to the modernization and professionalization of the armedforces, the Commander-in-Chief had been given discretionary authority to discharge withoutnotice any soldier suspected of having violated the fundamental rights of an individual or ofhaving collaborated with illegal groups. In addition, most of the operations to spray unlawfulcrops had been carried out in areas where the self-defence groups were particularly active.63. Colombia was endeavouring to protect the defenders of human rights and had set asideUS$ 5 million for the protection of about 40 people. Requests for protection had increased as thenumber of acts of violence rose, but budget resources remained insufficient. Colombia asked for---------PAGE ENDED--------- E/CN.4/2001/SR.14 page 13the financial support of the international community to strengthen its protection programme. Italso asked for the help of NGOs in order to pursue its plan of action for people displaced becauseof the conflict.64. The Governments action had been especially fruitful in the legislative field. A newMilitary Penal Code had been adopted, by virtue of which members of the armed forces who hadcommitted human rights violations would be brought before civilian and not military courts. Thenew Penal Code covered violations of international humanitarian law and made forceddisappearance a crime. Henceforth, the law prohibited the enlistment of minors in the armedforces. The Government had acceded to the treaty establishing the International Criminal Courtand planned to submit it for approval to Congress.65. Colombia was aware that until it had found a negotiated settlement to the armed conflictand obtained agreements on respect for international humanitarian law, the rights of its citizenswould continue to be systematically flouted. It must not be forgotten that the guerrillas wereresponsible for the violence in the country. They were the ones who carried out abductions, usedanti-personnel mines, harassed the indigenous population and continued to enlist minors, thuswidening the tear in the social fabric. The international community had to understand andsupport Colombias struggle for peace, freedom and democracy.ORGANIZATION OF WORK (item 3 of the agenda)66. Mr. NOIRFALISSE (Belgium), speaking on behalf of the European Union, said that theUnion had been prompted to take the floor under item 3 by the announcement by Mrs. Robinson,at the beginning of the session, that she did not intend to seek reappointment. The Union wishedto express its deepest appreciation to the High Commissioner for the excellent work she hadcarried out during her tenure. Her steadfast efforts had enhanced her Offices profile and madethe Palais Wilson a true hub and universal home for human rights. The High Commissioner hadput human rights at the forefront of the international agenda and had mainstreamed human rightsinto all United Nations activities and programmes. The European Union also wished to thankthe High Commissioner for her efforts to mobilize the international community with a view toreaching a consensus in the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and relatedintolerance, in particular within the framework of the World Conference in Durban.67. The European Union considered that the High Commissioner had fully implemented thedifficult mandate entrusted to her, in a balanced manner and with great personal and professionalintegrity. During the special sessions and debates of the Commission held during her tenure,Mrs. Robinson had dealt with political issues impartially and had presented high-quality reports.She had actively contributed to the application of a rights-based approach to issues such as theeradication of poverty, the realization of economic, social and cultural rights and theimplementation of the right to development. The Offices technical assistance and advisoryservices had expanded considerably and memoranda of understanding had been signed withrequesting States. Thanks to cooperation with UNDP, overlap had been avoided and synergiesof effort created within the United Nations system. In that context, it was regrettable that, inspite of positive responses from States to the Offices annual appeals, not all core activities werefinanced out of the United Nations regular budget.---------PAGE ENDED---------E/CN.4/2001/SR.14page 14RACISM, RACIAL DISCRIMINATION, XENOPHOBIA AND ALL FORMS OFDISCRIMINATION (item 6 of the agenda) (continued) (E/CN.4/2001/20, E/CN.4/2001/21 andCorr.1, E/CN.4/2001/22, E/CN.4/2001/NGO/5, E/CN.4/2001/NGO/11, E/CN.4/2001/NGO/28,E/CN.4/2001/NGO/38, E/CN.4/2001/NGO/41, E/CN.4/2001/NGO/57, E/CN.4/2001/NGO/58,E/CN.4/2001/NGO/61, E/CN.4/2001/NGO/62, E/CN.4/2001/NGO/73, E/CN.4/2001/NGO/155,E/CN.4/2001/NGO/162, E/CN.4/2001/NGO/164, E/CN.4/2000/NGO/11 and Corr. 1, A/55/304)68. Mr. MBOMIO (North-South XXI) said that the victims of racism did not intend tocontent themselves with the impression made by the announcement of the World Conference totake place in Durban. During that Conference, the Africans demanding reparations for centuriesof enslavement would have to be heard. It was their hope that the slave trade, the blackholocaust, would finally be recognized as a crime against humanity by the internationalcommunity, as had the Jewish holocaust committed during the Second World War. The WorldConference against Racism had to be a solemn moment of truth, an act of recognition of thephenomenon of racism, not only in its traditional form but also in all its modern forms, whichwere essentially economic, social and cultural in nature. Indeed, modern racism consisted intransforming citizens into consumer machines, the only criteria for selection being theirsolvency. The global village was thus being transformed into a global discriminatory societydominated by a handful of wealthy people in a limited number of countries of the North to whichthe people of the South had no access.69. The draft declaration and programme of action presented by the Conference secretariat atthe meeting of the Intersessional Working Group held on 6 March in Geneva represented a hugestep backwards in terms of the proposals made by regional groups, in particular the Santiago andDakar declarations.70. The fact that the World Conference would be held on the emblematic soil of South Africaalso served as a reminder that apartheid was a hideous practice thanks to which whitecolonialists, whose strength was their only claim to legitimacy, had occupied the countrys bestland. The same racist phenomenon had appeared 50 years earlier in Palestine, where the State ofIsrael, made up of colonialists from around the world, occupied and surrounded Palestinianterritory, administering it as so many Bantustans, at present under the leadership of a person whohad once been involved in the Sabra and Chatila massacres.71. The World Conference should denounce, fight and eliminate racism, a sine qua noncondition for humanity to regain the close ties of neighbourliness and community described byMrs. Robinson in her statement of 24 March 1999.72. Mr. KIRKYACHARIAN (Movement against Racism and for Friendship among Peoples)(MRAP) observed that, in the face of the wide range of phenomena covered by the wordracism, the MRAP had decided to examine the terms definition. The preceding year it hadproposed that the definition be the overall effect of the interiorization of structural inequality,the word interiorization being understood in the sense of justification. That definition was ofgreat practical value, for in the absence of an overall concept, anti-racism might be limited to thefight against effects whereas the causes, ever present, continued to produce fresh exclusions,giving the impression of a world struggling to catch up.---------PAGE ENDED--------- E/CN.4/2001/SR.14 page 1573. As the MRAP had indicated in its document on the issue (E/CN.4/2001/NGO/155), thedefinition of racism as the justification for a structural inequality facilitated understanding of therelationship between racism and immigration, racism and poverty, racism and inequality, and soforth. It also made it easier to understand why major States were witnessing the emergence ofnew and very acute forms of racism.74. It would be a source of concern if the World Conference did not adopt practicalresolutions that were truly binding on the participating States. The resolutions should concerninter alia the penal repression of racism, the struggle against discrimination and the plight ofmigrant workers, their families and the children born to immigrants, who were not fullyintegrated. That was the first of many first steps to be taken.75. Ms. LI (Transnational Radical Party) introduced herself as a practitioner of Falun Gong,a movement subjected to brutal repression in China since 1999. Her father, also a Falun Gongpractitioner, had left China after being imprisoned, leaving his family behind. She had soughtrefuge in the United Kingdom, where she was a student. Since her fathers departure, Ms. Lisfamily had faced growing hardship.76. Mr. SHEN Yongxiang (China), speaking on a point of order, said that the speakersstatement had absolutely nothing to do with the agenda.77. The CHAIRMAN, after having asked the speaker to keep to the agenda, told her that shewould have the opportunity to speak under other agenda items. The agenda item underdiscussion was racial discrimination and not discrimination on religious grounds.78. Ms. RAJAKUMARI (Pax Romana) said that the situation of young people was of majorconcern. Pax Romana therefore welcomed the encouragement given by the High Commissionerfor Human Rights regarding youth participation in the World Conference against Racism to beheld in 2001. In doing so, Mrs. Robinson recalled that children and young people weresometimes not only victims but also victimizers. They killed and were killed, they were torturedand had tortured others. Certain regional preparatory meetings had reflected those concerns butrather superficially. Young people should not be present at the World Conference as merewitnesses but as active participants.79. Pax Romanas other concern related to the caste-based discrimination affectingapproximately 260 million people in Asia. In India, for example, in violation of the IndianConstitution, people belonging to certain castes - the untouchables - were allowed to embraceonly the Hindu, Sikh or Buddhist religions. They could belong to no other religion.80. Lastly, Pax Romana noted with concern that a large number of countries from the Asiaand Pacific region had not ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Formsof Racial Discrimination. In addition, only one fifth of those which had ratified had accepted thecompetence of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination under article 14.81. In conclusion, Pax Romana wished to make three recommendations. First, States shouldactively involve young people in the struggle against racism at all levels. Secondly, youngpeople should be an integral part of every stage of the World Conference against Racism, and---------PAGE ENDED---------E/CN.4/2001/SR.14page 16should be co-architects of the draft declaration and plan of action. Thirdly, Pax Romana urgedall Member States to ratify the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms ofRacial Discrimination and to comply with the obligations thereby contracted.82. Mr. HASAN (International Institute for Peace) considered the history of Bangladesh theperfect example of criminal violence brought about by intolerance and racism. Imbued with anideology very close to that of the Nazis, the Pakistanis had always considered themselves to besuperior to the Bengalis. For that reason, when the latter had decided to choose their ownleaders, the Pakistani military junta had reacted with massacres on a scale tantamount to genuineethnic cleansing. The main victims of Pakistani discrimination were the Hindus among theBengalis, whom General Niazi had called monkeys. During the Bangladesh war of liberation,in 1971, Pakistani troops had eliminated 3 million Bengalese, including countless Hindus killedmerely because of their religion, and carried out mass deportations. Bangladesh had been put tofire and the sword and had not yet repaired all the material and psychological damage that theracist savagery of the Pakistani troops had inflicted.83. Mr. BENNET (Afro-Asian Peoples Solidarity Organization) said that the humantendency to believe that one group was superior to another had been a bane leading todestruction, as had recently been demonstrated in the former Yugoslavia, Afghanistan andRwanda. It was unfortunately true that the origins of the scourge of discrimination based onreligion and race lay in predominantly white nations. The crusades, colonization and slaverywere the precursors of Nazism, neo-Nazism and the discriminatory immigration policies ofmodern, developed nations which looked at the colour of a persons skin before opening theirdoors.84. The World Conference against Racism was therefore a timely opportunity to shape a newworld order in which every country was forced, if not totally to eradicate discrimination, at leastseverely to punish it. Attempts were currently being made in certain quarters, however, toinclude unrelated considerations in the definition of racism, to define societies based on aspecific system of division of labour as racist, incriminating the caste system. That representedan attempt to divert attention from the true problems, such as neo-Nazi acts of aggression inGermany or the growth of exclusivist parties that denied equality to those with a darker skin.The World Conference must be clear apartheid may have been dismantled, but there continuedto exist a thousand other battles to be fought against discrimination.85. Mr. THARAKAM (Robert F. Kennedy Memorial) observed that discrimination based ondescent, and not only on race, was also covered by the International Convention on theElimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and that in that respect the caste systemconstituted one of the most destructive forms of discrimination. The Seminar of Experts onMigrants and Trafficking in Persons, held in Thailand in September 2000, had noted that castediscrimination was often a root cause of trafficking and migration. The Commission on HumanRights therefore had to call on all countries to campaign with a view to having the WorldConference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Associated Intoleranceaddress that kind of discrimination and identify concrete measures to end it. The Commissionshould support the appointment of a special rapporteur to monitor the problem, which affected atleast 240 million people around the world. The countries in which such practices existed had toenact or enhance measures to combat descent-based and caste discrimination. Lastly, all---------PAGE ENDED--------- E/CN.4/2001/SR.14 page 17Governments should fully accept and implement the recommendations issued by the Committeeon the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, the Sub-Commission on the Promotion andProtection of Human Rights and other human rights bodies. The resolution entitledDiscrimination on the basis of work and descent, adopted in August 2000 by theSub-Commission, was particularly relevant.86. Ms. LUPING (Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies) believed that the internationalcommunity had an obligation to ensure universal respect for human rights, including thefundamental right to protection against discrimination of the Palestinian people. ThePalestinians were one of the indigenous peoples on the lands of Israel and Palestine they hadlived there for millennia. By protecting them against discrimination and by holding Israel toaccount, the international community would not be discriminating in any way against the Jewishpeople, but simply helping to eliminate discriminatory Israeli policies. The Israeli military hadalways clearly stated its twin aims to ensure the domination of the Jewish majority in Israel andthe occupied territories and to bring about segregation and geographical, economic, social andcultural separation between the Palestinians and their Jewish neighbours. That policy applied toPalestinian Israeli citizens living in Israel and to Palestinians living in the occupied territories.87. The discriminatory and segregationist policies of Israel were strikingly similar to thoseadopted in apartheid-era South Africa and in illegally occupied Namibia. It was only thanks tothe measures taken by the international community, in particular the United Nations, thatdiscrimination and apartheid were brought to a halt. Accordingly, the Cairo Institute for HumanRights Studies asked the international community to take measures, impose sanctions and decreea boycott against Israel, as it had against South Africa, to protect Palestinians and combat the lastapartheid regime. The meeting rose at 1.05 p.m. ",

The Committee received the initial report of the Former Yugoslav Republic ofMacedonia (CRC/C/8/Add.36) on 4 March 1997 and considered the report at its 597th and598th meetings (see CRC/C/SR.597-598), held on 17 January 2000 and adopted* the followingconcluding observations. A. Introduction2. The Committee welcomes the submission of the State partys initial report and the writtenanswers to the list of issues (CRC/C/Q/MAC/1) submitted by the State party. The Committeenotes with appreciation the constructive efforts made by the delegation to provide additionalinformation in the course of the dialogue.* At the 615th meeting, held on 28 January 2000.GE.00-40871 (E)---------PAGE ENDED---------CRC/C/15/Add.118page 2 B. Positive aspects3. The Committee is encouraged by the State partys establishment of an Ombudsperson forchildrens rights and notes the State partys progress in reducing infant and maternal mortality inrecent years and the progress made in raising significantly the levels of enrolment of children toprimary school.4. The Committee commends the State party for its efforts to support refugees fromneighbouring countries and to protect the rights of children among the refugee communities. C. Factors and difficulties impeding the implementation of the Convention5. The Committee recognizes the continuing economic and political transitions within theState party, the serious armed conflicts which have emerged repeatedly in neighbouring States,the imposition of international sanctions upon parts of the region and the associated economicdifficulties which hinder the full implementation of the Convention. D. Principal subjects of concern, suggestions and recommendations D.1. General measures of implementation (arts. 4, 42 and 44, para. 6 of the Convention)Legislation6. The Committee notes that, in accordance with article 118 of the Constitution,international agreements are incorporated in domestic legislation and are directly applicable.However, the Committee is concerned that the Constitution and other legislation, partlypre-dating the entry into force of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, do not appear tofully reflect the provisions and principles of the Convention. The Committee is concerned,further, that the Conventions principles and provisions are not reflected in policy andadministrative practice.7. The Committee urges the State party to review its legislation and adopt appropriateamendments, to ensure conformity with the Convention. In addition, the Committeerecommends that the State party make further efforts to ensure that the provisions andprinciples of the Convention are reflected, applied and enforced in State policy andadministrative practices.Coordination/independent monitoring structures8. The Committee is concerned that there is no mechanism responsible for the coordinationand evaluation of the implementation of the Convention.9. The Committee recommends that the State party allocate principal responsibilityfor the coordination and evaluation of implementation of the Convention to a singlemechanism.---------PAGE ENDED--------- CRC/C/15/Add.118 page 310. While the Committee is encouraged by the State partys efforts to develop projectsfocusing on children, the Committee wishes to emphasize the importance for the State party ofdeveloping an overall national plan of action for the effective implementation of childrensrights, and that individual projects should each form a part of a larger strategy.11. The Committee recommends that the State party develop a cross-ministerial plan ofaction for the implementation of childrens rights, pursue implementation of the variousprojects referred to in the State partys report and ensure coordination of policy makingand implementation. The Committee further urges the State party to adopt a holistic childrights approach to implementing the Convention and to consider seeking technicalassistance from UNICEF in this domain.Allocation of budgetary resources/regional disparities article 412. The Committee recognizes the hardship imposed by the current socio-economicdifficulties in the State party and expresses its concern over the impact that the financial situationmay have on children, including, notably, those from poor families. The Committee also notes,with concern, that there are significant regional disparities with regard to the extent to whichchildren benefit from the respect of their rights.13. In the light of articles 2, 3 and 6 of the Convention, and with a view to achieving fullapplication of article 4, the Committee urges the State party to make every effort to protectchildrens rights from the negative effects of the current economic situation, includingthrough the prioritization of budgetary allocations in a manner which ensures the bestpossible implementation of the Convention and to the maximum extent of the State partysavailable resources. In this regard, the Committee further recommends that the Stateparty give particular attention to the situation of children of poor families and fromregions experiencing particular economic difficulties.Cooperation with NGOs14. The Committee encourages the State party to increase its support for, andcooperation with, NGOs with regard to implementation of the Convention.Dissemination of the Convention15. In the light of article 42 of the Convention and recognizing the State partys effortsto disseminate human rights, including childrens rights, in schools and to specificprofessional groups, the Committee urges the State party to make additional efforts todisseminate the Convention, to provide training on its provisions for professionals,including law officials, teachers and health workers, and to provide teaching on itsprovisions to the adult population. The Committee recommends that the State partyconsider seeking technical advice from UNICEF in this regard.---------PAGE ENDED---------CRC/C/15/Add.118page 4 D.2. General principles (arts. 2, 3, 6 and 12 of the Convention)Principle of non-discrimination article 216. The Committee is concerned that under the current arrangements with regard to thethree child policy, children from families with more than three children are at a disadvantagewith regard to access to social service, financial and other assistance.17. In the light of article 2 of the Convention, the Committee recommends that the Stateparty find alternative means to implement the three child policy, other than excluding thefourth child from social service benefits, and ensure that all children have equal access tosuch assistance without discrimination.Principle of the best interests of the child article 318. The Committee welcomes the information provided in the State partys answers tothe list of issues concerning implementation of the best interests principle and encouragesthe State party to continue to integrate the principle into all legislative and administrativepractices, and to review its decision-making and implementation procedures so as to ensurethat the best interests of the child are a primary consideration.The right to have views heard and given due weight article 1219. Recognizing the provisions in domestic legislation protecting the childs rights to haveviews heard, the Committee remains concerned that implementation of this right is notadequately reflected in administrative policy and practice, including in the activities of theCentres for Social Work.20. In the light of article 12 of the Convention and recognizing the progress made by theState party in respecting the right of children to have their views heard through thechildrens parliament and in schools, the Committee recommends that the State partycontinue to take all appropriate measures to ensure that children are provided withappropriate opportunities to express their views and that these are given due weight, inaccordance with the provisions of the Convention. D.3. Civil rights and freedoms (arts. 7, 8. 13-17 and 37 (a))The right to birth registration article 721. The Committee is concerned that, in spite of relevant legislation and an increasingnumber of births in hospitals, there are still children in the State party who are not registered atbirth and is further concerned at the fact that a large proportion of unregistered births are ofRoma children. The Committee recalls that official birth registration is a fundamental first steptowards securing the rights of a child to a name and nationality, whether in the State of birth orin another State, and to gaining access to social assistance, health, education and other services.---------PAGE ENDED--------- CRC/C/15/Add.118 page 522. In the light of article 7 of the Convention, the Committee urges the State party tomake every effort to enforce birth registration and to facilitate the registration processwith regard to the children of parents, or other responsible persons, who may haveparticular difficulties in providing the necessary documentation.Corporal punishment23. Recognizing the State partys efforts to end corporal punishment practices in schools, theCommittee is nevertheless concerned that such practices have not been entirely ended in schoolsand also continue outside of the school context.24. The Committee urges the State party to continue its efforts to end corporalpunishment practices in schools, to monitor and record the use of corporal punishmentagainst children in all contexts, and to make every effort to prevent the practice of corporalpunishment including through its prohibition by law. The Committee further encouragesthe State party to undertake campaigns to raise the awareness of parents, in particular, ofthe harmful effects of corporal punishment. D.4. Family environment and alternative care (arts. 5 18, paras. 1-2 9-11 19-21 25 27, para. 4 and 39)25. The Committee expresses its concern that in decisions with regard to the familyenvironment and the alternative care of children the principles of the Convention are not alwaysfully respected.26. The Committee recommends that the State party further develop legislationsupporting foster care, and that the State party strengthen community services in favour offamilies with economic, social or other difficulties and families caring for children withdisabilities and with emotional or behavioural problems, in a manner which assuresgreater respect for the principles of the Convention.27. The Committee is concerned that incidents of sexual abuse and family violence may notbe adequately identified and addressed.28. The Committee recommends that the State party conduct training for the police andthe staff of the Centres for Social Work on the detection of child abuse and domesticviolence, and on suitable responses.29. The Committee is concerned that the Centres for Social Work are under-resourced,limiting their capacity to perform their many functions effectively, including those in favour ofchildren. The Committee is further concerned that the Centres for Social Work are currentlyauthorized to make decisions relative to the placement of a child with one parent, withoutjudicial review.30. The Committee urges the State party to consider the use of alternative mechanismswith regard to implementation of the Conventions provisions concerning the familyenvironment and alternative care or to increase the resources available to the Centres for---------PAGE ENDED---------CRC/C/15/Add.118page 6Social Work. Recognizing the existence of an appeals procedure under currentarrangements, the Committee nevertheless recommends that the State party establish amechanism providing for judicial review of situations requiring the placement of a childwith one parent. D.5. Basic health and welfare (arts. 6 18, para. 3 23 24 26 27, paras. 1-3)31. Recognizing the State partys efforts to provide financial and other assistance to ensurethe access of children to health care, the Committee is nevertheless concerned that not allchildren have equal and adequate access to health care including, notably, children from regionsfacing particular economic hardship. Further, the Committee is concerned that the State partyspolicy of requiring adolescents aged 15 to 18 to make financial contributions to their health carecosts may limit their access to health care, including sexual health education.32. The Committee urges the State party to continue its efforts to ensure that allchildren, and from all regions, have equal access to health care services. The Committeefurther recommends that the State party review policies requiring 15- to 18-year-olds toshare costs, and to ensure that these policies do not restrict the access of adolescents to fullhealth care.Children with disabilities article 2333. While aware of the State partys efforts to integrate children with disabilities into formaleducation and into regular recreation programmes, the Committee remains concerned thatchildren with disabilities remain excluded from many such activities. With regard to childrenwith disabilities requiring additional facilities, the Committee is concerned by the quality ofeducational, health and other facilities available, inter alia, facilities providing access to schools.34. In the light of the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Personswith Disabilities (General Assembly resolution 48/96) and the Committeesrecommendations adopted at its Day of General Discussion on the Rights of Children withDisabilities (CRC/C/69), the Committee recommends that the State party make furtherefforts to integrate children with disabilities into educational and recreational programmescurrently used by children without disabilities. With particular reference to article 23 ofthe Convention, the Committee further recommends that the State party continue with itsprogrammes to improve the physical access of children with disabilities to public servicebuildings, including schools, review the facilities and assistance available to children withdisabilities and in need of special services, and improve these services in accordance withthe provisions and spirit of the Convention.35. With reference to article 23, paragraph 3, of the Convention, the Committee furtherencourages the State party to strengthen its efforts to benefit from internationalcooperation, including from UNICEF, in favour of children with disabilities, with a view toimproving State policy and action.---------PAGE ENDED--------- CRC/C/15/Add.118 page 7Infant mortality36. Recognizing the progress made in reducing infant mortality, the Committee, nevertheless,acknowledges the State partys recognition of, and expresses its own concern at, the continuingelevated incidence of such mortality.37. Noting the correlation, identified by studies, between low education among mothersand high infant mortality, and between the incidence of such mortality and certain regions,the Committee urges the State party to continue its efforts to address this concern,inter alia, through the effective provision of adequate health education to mothers. TheCommittee recommends that the State party seek technical assistance from UNICEF andWHO in this regard.HIV/AIDS38. Recognizing the State partys significant efforts to address health concerns related toHIV/AIDS, the Committee is concerned that such efforts be maintained in the interests ofpreventing the spread of HIV/AIDS.39. The Committee recommends that the State party continue with its current efforts toaddress HIV/AIDS concerns, including through the continuous use of effective monitoringand prevention mechanisms. The Committee recommends that the State party seektechnical assistance in this regard from WHO.Adolescent health/pregnancy among girls40. Acknowledging the State partys recognition of problems in the area of adolescent andsexual health issues, the Committee joins the State party in expressing concern, in particular atthe high level of abortions among girls and at the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases.41. The Committee urges the State party to strengthen data collection methods withregard to adolescent health concerns. The Committee recommends, further, that the Stateparty increase its efforts to promote adolescent health policies and strengthen reproductivehealth education and counselling services, inter alia with regard to HIV/AIDS, STDs,pregnancy among girls and abortion. The Committee recommends that the State partyseek technical assistance from WHO. D.6. Education, leisure and cultural activities (arts. 28, 29, 31)The right to education article 2842. The Committee acknowledges the recent marked increases in the enrolment of children inprimary schools and other increases in secondary and university enrolment. However, theCommittee remains concerned that a significant proportion of school-aged children do not attendprimary and, notably, secondary school. Specifically, the Committee is concerned at the lowproportion of girls in general, and children from the Roma minority in particular, who enroll in---------PAGE ENDED---------CRC/C/15/Add.118page 8educational establishments at all levels, and at the low numbers of children from all minoritygroups who enroll at the secondary school level. The Committee is concerned, further, at theextremely high drop-out rates of girls from primary and secondary education.43. The Committee recommends that the State party pursue its efforts to increase theenrolment levels of all children from minorities in primary and secondary schools, withspecial attention to girls in general and children from the Roma minority in particular.44. The Committee recognizes the State partys significant efforts to make primary andsecondary education available in minority languages, but expresses its concern that manyprimary and secondary schools are under-resourced and, in particular, that primary andsecondary school education available in minority languages is of a lower standard than thatavailable in the Macedonian language. The Committee notes, further, the inevitable effect ofpoor primary and secondary education in discouraging enrolment, raising the number of childrenwho drop out and in limiting the numbers of children from minorities who are able to passexaminations leading to university education.45. With reference to articles 2 and 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, andwith a view to ensuring an equal standard of educational services in all schools, toencouraging increased enrolment, to discouraging children from dropping out and toincreasing the numbers of children from minorities who follow higher education, theCommittee recommends that the State party review the allocation of financial and otherresources to all primary and secondary schools, with particular attention to raising thequality of education in minority language schools. The Committee recommends, inaddition, that the State party consider increasing the numbers of hours of teaching of theMacedonian language in minority language schools, on a voluntary basis, with a view toensuring that children who are minority language speakers are able to participate on amore equal level with Macedonian-speaking children at higher education levels at whichentrance examinations and teaching are conducted primarily in the Macedonian language.The Committee suggests further that the curricula in all schools should include a greaterfocus on the personal development and vocational training of students and on inter-ethnictolerance. The Committee recommends that the State party seek technical assistance fromUNICEF in this regard. D.7. Special protection measures (arts. 22, 38, 39, 40, 37 (b)-(d), 32-36)Administration of juvenile justice articles 37, 39 and 4046. The Committee is concerned at the absence, in the State party report, of information onprinciples of judicial sentencing of juveniles and data on the existence and use of alternatives toimprisonment as a sentencing option for Juvenile Councils.47. The Committee recommends that the State party consider relevant reforms ofjuvenile justice policy and practice in accordance with articles 37 and 40 and 39 of theConvention on the Rights of the Child, as well as the United Nations Standard MinimumRules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (the Beijing Rules), the United Nations---------PAGE ENDED--------- CRC/C/15/Add.118 page 9Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency (the Riyadh Guidelines) and theUnited Nations Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty, inparticular with a view to ensuring that detention and imprisonment are used only as ameasure of last resort, for example by developing alternative measures.48. Recognizing the existence of psychological assistance facilities under the auspices of theCentres for Social Work, the Committee, nevertheless, remains concerned at the absence ofmeasures to provide for the physical and psychological recovery and reintegration of childrenwho have been the victims of crime, and of children who have participated in judicialproceedings or who have been confined in institutions.49. In the light of article 39 of the Convention, the Committee recommends that theState party urgently establish appropriate programmes to provide for the physical andpsychological recovery and reintegration of such children and that these mechanisms beused in the administration of juvenile justice.Child labour/commercial exploitation article 3250. The Committee is concerned at the reported incidence of child labour within the Stateparty, and notes that the labour of children under 15 may also prevent these children fromattending primary school and is particularly prevalent among certain minority groups.51. The Committee recommends that the State party collect and publish data on theincidence of child labour, both under the age of 15 and between the ages of 15 and 18. TheCommittee also recommends that the State party address cases of economic exploitation ofchildren, in particular street children, including through the enforcement of primaryschool attendance obligations and through efforts to raise secondary school attendance.The Committee further suggests that the State party ratify International LabourOrganizations Conventions No. 138, Concerning the Minimum Age for Admission toEmployment (1973), and No. 182 Concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for theElimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour (1999).Drug abuse52. The Committee acknowledges the State partys recognition of, and expresses its ownconcern at, recent increases in drug abuse among children.53. The Committee recommends that the State party continue to monitor the incidenceof drug abuse among children, proceed with preventive measures and make appropriaterehabilitative and other assistance available to children who are already addicted to drugs.Children of minorities or of indigenous groups article 3054. While recognizing the State partys efforts to ensure equal enjoyment of rights forchildren from minority communities, the Committee remains concerned that children from someminority populations, and the Roma in particular, do not enjoy full respect of their rights.---------PAGE ENDED---------CRC/C/15/Add.118page 1055. The Committee encourages the State party to continue its efforts to ensure the equalimplementation of the Convention for all children and to make every effort to ensure thatthe children of minorities are able to benefit fully from the Conventions principles andprovisions. The Committee recommends that the State party seek technical assistance fromUNICEF in this regard.Dissemination of the report, written answers, concluding observations56. Finally, in the light of article 44, paragraph 6, of the Convention, the Committeerecommends that the initial report and written replies submitted by the State party bemade widely available to the public at large and that publication of the report beconsidered, along with the relevant summary records and concluding observations adoptedthereon by the Committee. Such a document should be widely distributed in order togenerate debate and awareness of the Convention, its implementation and monitoringwithin the Government, the Parliament and the general public, including concerned non-governmental organizations. ----- ",
